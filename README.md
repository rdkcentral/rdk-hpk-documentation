## Description

This is the public documentation to support the Hardware Porting Kit (`HPK`), for any vendor / third party to read. This document will be the consolidating jump point for all documentation with links to other open documentations.

## Hardware Porting Kit

The Hardware Porting Kit (`HPK`) represents an advanced stage in the progression of the extensively delineated Hardware Abstraction Layer (`HAL`). It is enhanced with extensive documentation and thorough test suites, empowering `OEM` or `SOC` vendors to independently validate their ports prior to submission for final integration and deployment with an operator. This kit serves as a comprehensive resource, enabling `OEMs` and/or `SOC` vendors to autonomously undergo certification for their devices.
