# RDK Hardware Porting Kit (HPK)

The RDK Hardware Porting Kit (HPK) provides a centralized resource for vendors integrating their hardware layer with the RDK stack.  It simplifies this process by providing a unified set of tools, documentation, and test suites.

Specifically, the HPK includes:

* **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) API header files:** These define the interfaces vendors must implement to ensure compatibility.
* **Comprehensive software tests:** These validate the vendor's HAL implementation against RDK middleware requirements.
* **Standards & Best Practices:** Guidelines on coding standards, documentation, branching strategies, and interface development.
* **Testing Methodologies:** Outlines various testing levels and frameworks, including TDD and system interface testing.
* **Code Examples & Advanced Topics:** Practical examples for dynamic library loading, plugin development, virtual device development, and control plane overviews.
* **FAQ & Troubleshooting:** Addresses common challenges related to Git, Vagrant, C macros, testing, and RDK tools.
* **Technology Overviews:** Explains key technologies and frameworks like UT-Core and the RDK Docker toolchain.
* **vDevice Support:**  Provides the ability to develop and test vendor layers using virtualized hardware within a VM.  This "vDevice" approach simulates hardware components and drivers, enabling early testing, cost-effectiveness, reproducibility, and flexibility.  It allows developers to test against various hardware profiles without needing physical hardware.

The HPK serves as a single point of reference, streamlining vendor integration, reducing redundant effort, and promoting consistency across RDK platforms. It accelerates hardware enablement and improves the quality of the RDK ecosystem.
